	 <p>In this experiment we are investigating the nature of a phenomenon in language called "islands." In a lot of cases, 
	 such as when forming a question, you can move parts of sentences around based on certain rules of language. However, 
	 sometimes it is unacceptable to move certain things out of their "base" place within the sentence. This is an "island." 
	 This experiment investigates what factors in language cause islands to occur, specifically testing to see if there is a 
	 relationship between certain elements of the sentence, such as the nouns and the verbs.
