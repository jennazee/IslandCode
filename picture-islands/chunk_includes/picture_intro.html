	<p>Thank you for participating in our study</p>

	<p>You will see a series of statements or questions followed by a rating scale 0-10. Your job is to read the sentence and then provide a rating of how acceptable or "natural" the sentence sounds. Select your rating by clicking the appropriate rating.</p>

	<p>Following the rating of each sentence, you will see another question followed by three possible answers. Read the question and select the appropriate answer. These questions are to make sure that you are paying attention. If you get a certain number wrong, you will not receive payment for this HIT.</p>
	
	<p>We'll start with a few practice items so you get used to the experimental interface.</p>
